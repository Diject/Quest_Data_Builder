## Example Configuration File
```
{
	//Initialization type.
	//Possible options:
	//"Auto" - the generator tries to find paths to data files automatically, or reads them from "morrowindDirectory", or "omwLauncherCfgPath" + "omwOpenmwCfgPath", or "mo2BaseDirectory".
	//	If data is found, the first valid source will be used for generation: Morrowind directory > OpenMW data > Mod Organizer 2 data.
	//"Manual" - Same as "Auto", but allows you to select the data source for generation via CLI.
	//"Config" - Data is loaded from the "files" field or from "morrowindDirectory" + "gameFiles" in the config file.
	"initializer": "Manual",
	
	//Also log to log.txt. If the parameter is set from the config and not from the command line, the initial part of the logs will not be written to the file.
	"logToFile": true,
